# python-django

This is a production-ready setup for running Django on Docker. It has sensible defaults for security.

## Initialise your development environment
Only now launch pycharm and configure a project on this working directory.
All following commands must be run only once at project installation.

### First clone
The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/D-derinalp/python-django.git
$ cd python-django
```
