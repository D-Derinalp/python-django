            <h3>What Is Climate Change?</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>
            Climate change simply can be explained that long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. 
            These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, 
            human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.

            <h3>Causes of Climate Change</h3>
            <br/>
            <h5>Generating Power</h5>
            <p>
            Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels causes a large chunk of global emissions. Most electricity 
            is still generated by burning coal, oil, or gas, which produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide – powerful greenhouse 
            gases that blanket the Earth and trap the sun’s heat. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h5>Manufacturing Goods</h5>
            <p>
            Manufacturing and industry produce emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels to produce energy for making things 
            like cement, iron, steel, electronics, plastics, clothes, and other goods. Mining and other industrial processes also 
            release gases, as does the construction industry. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h5>Cutting Down Forests</h5>
            <p>
            Cutting down forests to create farms or pastures, or for other reasons, causes emissions, since trees, when they are cut, 
            release the carbon they have been storing. Each year approximately 12 million hectares of forest are destroyed. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h5>Using Transportation</h5>
            <p>
            Most cars, trucks, ships, and planes run on fossil fuels. That makes transportation a major contributor of greenhouse gases, 
            especially carbon-dioxide emissions. Road vehicles account for the largest part, due to the combustion of petroleum-based 
            products, like gasoline, in internal combustion engines.

        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h5>Producing Food</h5>
            <p>
            Producing food causes emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases in various ways, including through 
            deforestation and clearing of land for agriculture and grazing, digestion by cows and sheep, the production and use of fertilizers 
            and manure for growing crops, and the use of energy to run farm equipment or fishing boats, usually with fossil fuels.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h5>Powering Buildings </h5>
            <p>
            Globally, residential and commercial buildings consume over half of all electricity. As they continue to draw on coal, oil, 
            and natural gas for heating and cooling, they emit significant quantities of greenhouse gas emissions.

        <div class="col-sm-10">
            <h5>Consuming Too Much</h5>
            <p>
            Your home and use of power, how you move around, what you eat and how much you throw away all contribute to greenhouse gas 
            emissions. So does the consumption of goods such as clothing, electronics, and plastics. A large chunk of global greenhouse 
            gas emissions are linked to private households.

        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h5>Hotter Temperatures</h5>
            <p>
            As greenhouse gas concentrations rise, so does the global surface temperature. The last decade, 2011-2020, is the warmest on record. 
            Since the 1980s, each decade has been warmer than the previous one. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h5>Rising Ocean</h5>
            <p>
            The ocean soaks up most of the heat from global warming. The rate at which the ocean is warming strongly increased over the 
            past two decades, across all depths of the ocean. As the ocean warms, its volume increases since water expands as it gets warmer. 
            Melting ice sheets also cause sea levels to rise, threatening coastal and island communities.

    <div class="row mt-3">
        <div class="col-sm-10">
            <h5>More Severe Storms</h5>
            <p>
            Destructive storms have become more intense and more frequent in many regions. As temperatures rise, more moisture evaporates, 
            which worsens extreme rainfall and flooding, causing more destructive storms.  
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h5>Not Enough Food</h5>
            <p>
            Changes in the climate and increases in extreme weather events are among the reasons behind a global rise in hunger and poor 
            nutrition. Fisheries, crops, and livestock may be destroyed or become less productive. With the ocean becoming more acidic, 
            marine resources that feed billions of people are at risk.   
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h5>Loss Of Species</h5>
            <p>
            Climate change poses risks to the survival of species on land and in the ocean. These risks increase as temperatures climb. 
            Exacerbated by climate change, the world is losing species at a rate 1,000 times greater than at any other time in recorded 
            human history.

            <h5>Increased Drought</h5>
            <p>
            Climate change is changing water availability, making it scarcer in more regions. Global warming exacerbates water shortages 
            in already water-stressed regions and is leading to an increased risk of agricultural droughts affecting crops, and ecological
            droughts increasing the vulnerability of ecosystems.   
            </p>
            <br/> 
            <h5>More Health Risks</h5>
            <p>
            Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity. Climate impacts are already harming health, through air 
            pollution, disease, extreme weather events, forced displacement, pressures on mental health, and increased hunger and poor 
            nutrition in places where people cannot grow or find sufficient food.

        <div class="col-sm-10">
            <h5>Poverty And Displacement</h5>
            <p>
            Climate change increases the factors that put and keep people in poverty. Floods may sweep away urban slums, destroying homes 
            and livelihoods. Heat can make it difficult to work in outdoor jobs. Water scarcity may affect crops.
